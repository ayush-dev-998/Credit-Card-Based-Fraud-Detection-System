# Credit-Card-Based-Fraud-Detection-System

📌 Project Overview

The Credit Card-Based Fraud Detection System is a machine learning project designed to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. By analyzing transaction patterns and behaviors, the system improves financial security by detecting and flagging suspicious activities.

🎯 Features

Secure user authentication and role-based access.

Real-time fraud detection using Random Forest classifier.

Transaction monitoring with fraud detection alerts.

Data visualization with histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots.

Statistical analysis and regression-based fraud trend prediction.

API integration for real-time fraud detection.

Automated report generation for financial insights.

Scalable and optimized deployment.

🏗️ Tech Stack

Backend: Flask (Python)

Machine Learning: Random Forest, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Deployment: Flask API, Cloud/Local Server
📊 Dataset

Uses a publicly available credit card transaction dataset.

Features include transaction amount, location, time, and cardholder details.

Contains labeled data with fraudulent (1) and non-fraudulent (0) transactions.
